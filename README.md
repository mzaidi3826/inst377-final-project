EMAIL RISK CHECKER 
INST377 – Final Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

The Email Risk Checker is a web application that evaluates the potential risk of an email address. Users can submit an email and receive:
- A risk score (0–100)
- A risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- A clear explanation of contributing risk factors
- A visual chart representing the score
- A list of recently checked emails stored in a cloud database

The application integrates an external fraud-detection API, stores results using a database, and presents findings through a user-friendly interface.
