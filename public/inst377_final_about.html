            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Email Risk Checker</strong> is a dynamic web application created for
                the INST377: Dynamic Web Applications course. The goal of this project is to help
                users understand how vulnerable an email address may be to fraud, abuse, or data
                breaches by leveraging publicly available risk-analysis APIs.
            </p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Email accounts are a primary target for cyberattacks. Compromised email addresses
                can lead to identity theft, phishing attacks, financial fraud, and unauthorized
                access to sensitive systems. Many individuals and organizations are unaware of
                how exposed their email addresses may be until a breach has already occurred.
            </p>

            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
            <p>
                This project is designed around an <em>imaginary government organization</em>
                called the <strong>U.S. Department of Buses</strong>, which relies heavily on email
                for daily internal and external communication. The primary stakeholders include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Employees who want to know if their email accounts are at risk</li>
                <li>IT staff who need to identify vulnerable accounts proactively</li>
                <li>Executives who need data-driven insights to support cybersecurity decisions</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Users enter an email address on the home page. The application sends the email
                to a custom backend API, which then queries the
                <strong>IPQualityScore Email Risk API</strong>. The response is analyzed and
                transformed into a simplified risk score and classification:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Risk</strong> – Minimal signs of abuse or fraud</li>
                <li><strong>Medium Risk</strong> – Some indicators of suspicious behavior</li>
                <li><strong>High Risk</strong> – Strong evidence of fraud, abuse, or misuse</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The results are displayed in both text form and as a visual chart to make the
                information easy to understand.
            </p>

            <h2>How Risk Is Calculated</h2>
            <p>
                The Email Risk Checker evaluates multiple indicators commonly used in fraud
                detection systems. The chart below shows how different signals contribute
                to the final risk score.

            <h2>Data & APIs Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <strong>IPQualityScore Email API</strong> – Used to analyze email addresses for
                fraud risk, abuse history, and deliverability.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Public CSV Data</strong> – Sample government-style email addresses are
                loaded from a CSV file for testing and demonstration purposes.

            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this application is not to definitively label an email address as
                “safe” or “unsafe,” but to provide users with actionable information that can help
                them make informed decisions about cybersecurity and risk prevention.
